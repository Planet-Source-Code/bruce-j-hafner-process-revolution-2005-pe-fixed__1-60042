Fixed the Downloads (Sorry Guys)... I Deleted the old post to push users to the proper download loacaion. One of the other users will be posting an additional download location if you get no response.
While I will honor Free License requests for others..please limit this to PSC users...Thanks for the Community of PSC over the past 4 years.
This a fully free (With free upgrade to 2005 version when available) of a professional Flow Chart tool that is 5 star rated on many sites. It supports XML file format. Generates PDF, SVG, PNG, BMP, JPG and other formats. It includes a VBA compatible engine with an exposed ActiveX EXE object model to interact with the VBA engine (A requirement to integrate VBA into a product).
I hope you like it. Users at NASA, IKEA, US Airforce and others use it actively. I am still tweaking documentation.
FOr users that want sample VBA code, more advanced diagrams, info on developing plug-ins I will make myself available (as time permits).
Thanks again PSC
